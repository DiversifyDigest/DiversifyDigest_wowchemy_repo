Our goal at Diversify is to provide resources for scientists who are learning and growing in their anti-racism. Our <a href = "digest">**Digest**</a> is a biweekly curation of the latest research on diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice. In the future, we hope to occasionally take deep dives into some of these research articles on the <a href = "post">**Blog**</a>. We do our best to highlight the voices of academics who are Black, Indigenous, and/or Women of Color (BIWOC).
